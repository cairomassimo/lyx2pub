A command to automate the following process:

1. export a LyX file to LaTeX,
2. extract the content of the document
(i.e., between `\begin{document}` and `\end{document}`), and
3. insert it into an arbitrary LaTeX template.

This allows to comply with publisher's requirements
for submitted LaTeX files,
while still using LyX for writing.
